Welcome to lorisscandurra.com! This is the first blog post on my new website. This blog is here to document the everyday issues I encounter during my work. This blog should help engineers solve some of their problems and help me remember the solutions I found in the past. I might also post some posts that are out of context about stuff I find interesting or entertaining.

I wanted to use this blog post to introduce myself better. My name is Loris Scandurra, but you can just call me Loris. I am an engineer and project manager. For the past 10 years, I worked in the IT sector, where I solved problems ranging from client/server engineering to front-end/back-end development. But my interest in technology and science began a lot earlier than that. In elementary school, I would enjoy math and physics classes. As soon as I started reading, my favorite books were history and science-related.

After elementary school and high school, I started an apprenticeship as a system engineer. It took me some time to find a position as a system engineer. There were only a few openings and a lot of people interested. But I managed to land an apprenticeship position that opened the gates to the IT world for me. In the beginning, I was overwhelmed by it and even thought that I wasn't adequate for the job. But after the first year, I managed to wrap my head around it and enjoyed my work. In the third year of apprenticeship, I excelled as a student. I got the highest grade consistently for the entire year. I also participated in the national championship for engineers called SwissSkills, where I got in 5th place (not really what I was aiming at). I competed the following year again and got in 1st place (finally reached my initial goal).

I successfully finished my apprenticeship and started university, where I pursued a Bachelor of Science in Business Information Technology for four years. During my studies, I was working almost full-time as a system engineer. I switched the company I was working for after the first year of university to a more customer-facing company away from an internal IT department. At the new company, I made a lot of experience regarding customer interaction and system engineering for a wide variety of stakeholders with different backgrounds and expectations. In the last year of my studies, I changed the company again to a small consulting company where I worked as a project manager.

Two years later, I quit my job as a project manager and went a month to California to experience the west coast lifestyle. I really enjoyed California, I visited Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego. I really liked it there and their way of living (maybe I am doing a blog post on that in the future). After returning to Switzerland, I was a little lost and didn't know what to next, I didn't want to do the same thing I did before, I wanted to learn and experience new things. So I applied to the Apple Developer Academy in Naples. While the application process was running, I worked as a front-end engineer at a small developer office in Zurich. I was simultaneously working for a digital retailer where I helped with infrastructure issues and updating old infrastructure.

In August, I received the confirmation that I was accepted at the Apple Developer Academy in Naples and that it would start at the end of September. So mid-September, I went off to Naples to search for an apartment for the next nine months. I found a room in the center of Naples, which was well connected with public transport there. At the academy, I learned a lot about working in a diverse team with developers and designers (a more detailed look behind the scenes of the academy coming soon). I am still attending the academy until the end of June. Still, due to the Coronavirus pandemic, I am back in Switzerland.

And now we reached the present from here on I can't narrate in detail what's going to happen. But my ambition to learn and collect more experience in the IT sector is still hungry for more. My plans for the future are to start my own startup and try new things with customers who are willing to take risks and be innovative.
